          When we left our desks back in March, we didn’t think twice about
          leaving our office plants and reading glasses behind. Days became
          weeks, weeks stretched to months. (We eventually said goodbye to the
          fiddle leaf figs). Soon we were sharing<a
            class=" library-paragraph"
            href="error404.html"
          >
            tips on how to work together while apart</a
          >, and recognizing a fundamental
          <a class=" library-paragraph" href="error404.html"
            >shift in the way we work</a
          >. The resiliency of our Google colleagues was never in doubt, but
          this year we saw them flex and adapt in exciting new directions, all
          while meeting people where they are (usually at home), to deliver
          experiences that made us feel more connected, informed, and optimistic
          than ever. Most of the work we reviewed for this year’s annual revue
          was created remotely, during a global pandemic, and is shaped by that
          context. And yet, we think you’ll find that the noteworthy
          projects—including crowdsourced earthquake alerts and variable
          fonts—add up to a stellar year for UX at Google. As we look ahead to
          2021 (praise be!) take a minute to applaud the work and the people who
          made 2020 sing.

          This year, the lowly living room doubled as classroom, chem lab, and
          concert hall, but screens were the true MVP—especially for the
          school-age set. AI-powered homework help is just a smartphone snap
          away with the inventive

          helps little ones explore their unique interests via
          “teacher-approved” books, games, and videos (a godsend with
          after-school programs on pause). If music lessons are what you or your
          kids miss most, enter
          <a class=" library-paragraph" href="error404.html">Shared Piano</a>, a

          We’re biased, but the most versatile tool in the 2020 Google-verse is

          “Since we first introduced G Suite back in early 2016, the way we work
          has evolved,” Margaret Cyphers, UX & Creative Director of Google
          Workspace, tells us. “Our work has shifted to be even more connected
          and collaborative.” The transition to WFH gave Cyphers and her team
          increased urgency to ensure that these products not only work together
          seamlessly, but meet people where they are—in new work environments,
          constantly juggling personal and professional responsibilities (who
          has time to open another tab or app anyway?). Think of Google
          Workspace as your productivity multi-tool.

          Did someone say cozy season? This year we got reaaaaal close with our
          devices. As our collective screen time skyrocketed, Google hardware
          designers pulled the nature-inspired swipe for this year’s launches,
          which Google Seed Studio reflected in a
          <a href="error404.html">series of videos and visuals</a> that
          highlight the inspiration behind these products. “In times when life
          can feel so hectic, we want our devices to visually and tactilely
          reflect a moment of calm,” says Lead Industrial Designer Linda Jiang.
          On the same wavelength, Head of Human Centered Innovation & Strategy
          Hector Ouilhet
          <a href="error404.html"
            >advocated for more warmth in human computing </a
          >in a recent op-ed: “If designed right, ambient computing can subtly
          enhance people’s relationships with other people and the natural world
          around them, just as ambient lighting makes a living room feel warmer
          and ambient music makes a conversation flow smoother.”

          This year, <a href="error404.html">Google Fonts</a> turned ten in
          style with the launch of a shiny new site, and support for variable
          fonts. The <a href="error404.html">nifty type technology</a> allows
          fonts to flex based on various axes, like width, slant, and thickness.
          <a href="error404.html">Fraunces by Undercase Type </a>is one such
          example. This “Old Style” but not Old Style (wink, wink) serif was
          inspired by early 20th century display typefaces such as Windsor,
          Souvenir, and Cooper Black. The font’s lovely microsite lets you dial
          in the ‘wonk’ axis to your liking, and it’s beautiful to boot. If a
          low-contrast, humanist sans-serif is more your speed, check out
          <a href="error404.html">Commissioner</a>, another worthwhile addition
          to the GF catalog. And if it’s feelings you’d rather flex, may we
          gently recommend <a href="error404.html">Emoji Kitchen</a>. Built by
          the Android Expressions team, this well-timed release allows you to
          express every emotional intersection by mashing up two emoji to create
          anything from kissy cowboy to fiery trash can. It is 2020, after all.
